# Hypothesis testing: Heavier bats are ideal for attacking players to succeed in Australia.

### *Relationship between Bat weights (lbs.) and Runs Per Innings (RPI) of players in Australia (test cricket)*.

Runs Per Innings (RPI) is derived by dividing the total runs by the number of innings (doesn't consider Not Outs). 

Almost all of the Players with heavier bats have performed well in Australia compared to their performance in England (analysed in the previous test).

## How this study can be improved:

There are also other factors like Batter's current form, familiarity with conditions, batting position, & pace on the wicket impacting the total runs scored. These factors can be included to enhance this test. Also, data of lot more players could be added to validate this. I have tried to get the data of the players that use heavier bats along with some other established players that use light or medium weighed bats.
